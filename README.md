# Github-Helper 
I had to create so many Github repositories in one day, and writing the 5-6 lines of code each time was kinda boring and inconvenient so I had to make this small tool which helps me make a repository as quick as possible, try it out, and let me know if its worth it :D

# Usage
If the main.exe in dist folder doesn't launch properly please use the setup file to install it, it is only 22 MBs.


ENJOY!
